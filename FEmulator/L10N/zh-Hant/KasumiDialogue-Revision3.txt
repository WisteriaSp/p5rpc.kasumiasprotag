Hello! Just a few notes!
Persona 5 handles dialogue by asigning messages IDs, followed by speaker name. This is known as a message header
Example: [msg MSG_071_0_0 [Ann]]
Please do NOT modify this, except for the speaker name, which would be Ann in this case.
Speaker names should use the names from their respective official localizations.
Also you may either overwrite the English lines or add the translations below, but please keep the line breaks easy for me to recognize.
Either way please preserve the spacing I added.
Feel free to localize/translate this in a way that feels natural to you!

I have provided videos in the Google Drive that shows all of the English versions of these events as they are in the mod.

The game displays new lines when the [n] tag is used. For simplicity all [n] tags have just been made into new lines, 
but please keep P5R new line spacing in mind when writing dialogue.
Also, first name is represented by [f 4 2] or [fName] and the last name is [f 4 1] or [lName]. Please do not edit these tags, but do keep them in mind
as the game will replace the tag with the protagonist's first or last name.

If you're having trouble with placing the line breaks, consider making 40-45 characters the max limit for a single line.

Also no need to translate notes like (player's choice) or Re: (MSG Number)
If you have any questions then please feel free to ask me!

I HIGHLY encourage seeking out youtube videos in the language you're localizing to so you can get a feel for the
official localization.

[msg MSG_071_0_0 [Ann]]
That's a good idea. I'll go with
[f 4 2]-chan later.

Well, good night, Morgana!

NOTE: Most of this dialogue is original, but it's heavily based on the Yusuke and Ryuji bath scene from above - just with Ann instead of the guys!

[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Ann]]
Ahh, it feels soo nice!
I could stay in here forever.

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
It's nice to get away from 
the guys for a while. Don't you think?

(Player choice, response is 002 regardless of choice)
Yeah, but it's a bit hot....
She just keeps going...

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
Geez, you're right.
I'm sure she'll stop... eventually.

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
Hey so since it's just us...
Let's have a little girl talk!

I've been wondering
for a while now...

Girl to girl, what do you think
of the guys?

(Player choice)
Ryuji's kinda cute... Re: MSG_007
Yusuke-kun is so captivating... Re: MSG_008
Honestlyâ€¦ you stand out the most. Re: MSG_010
They're both great teammates. Re: MSG_009

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
Ooh, so that's the kind of guy you like!

Ryuji can be a little much,
but he's not so bad once
you get to know him.

Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
Kitagawa-kun?!

He's a little... odd... but I guess he can be charming!

Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
Umm... that's... not what I meant.

But I get you.

Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[f 4 2]-chan...

...W-wow haha, I see.
I-I wasn't expecting that...

But it makes me happy to hear that...

...I'm so glad I met you, [f 4 2]...

Let's do more things like this, okay?

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
Hey... I've been thinking, we really need to find
our next target.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ann]]
But the more I think about it...
Is going after famous people
really enough?

I mean, seeing people's reactions,
it's been making me think about
what we do...

(Player's choice)
It should be okay... Re: MSG_014
I don't know... Re: MSG_015

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
Yeah... we need to be more
cautious from now on.

I don't want this to backfire on us.

We need some kind of plan to
appeal to the public...

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
Don't you think we're being too
short-sighted?

I mean, is this really doing us any good?

I think we need a plan to appeal
to the public...

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
Hmm...

A plan huh...?

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
Argh, I can't think of anything right now!

Morgana specializes in info
about that world, right? So...

...

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ann]]
...Ughhhh! It's so damn hot!

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
How much do you have to keep adding
until you're satisfied, damn it!?

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
Argh! I can't stand it anymore!

Well, I have to get going anyways.
The trains are gonna stop soon.

Let's meet up again early next
week, okay? I'll contact everyone!

And let's hang out more! Got it?

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Ann]]
See you later!

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Ann]]
Well, I guess we'll all just go do our
own thing then.

Oh, but let's snap a quick pic
in our Kimonos!

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Haru]]
Great idea!

...

It couldn't hurt, right?

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Kasumi]]
Looks like it's just us now.

Sorry about skipping the picture,
I didn't want to intrude.

Oh, I was wondering earlier-what did you wish for at the shrine? (No localization needed for this line, this is just for context)

(Player choice)
I already forgot...
To stay healthy.
To become irresistible!

NOTE: This is the evening SMS dialogue for 1/1. I will manually provide an English video reference

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ryuji]]
Lookin' good!

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
I'm glad you think so. We all agreed to take a
picture of our kimonos.

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
Maybe we'll do a group shot next time.

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
This photo is good in its own way.
Indeed, I believe it will inspire
some good dreams.

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
But you gotta dream of specific
things if you want to have a good
year, right?





--- CORP008.msg --- Akechi Rank 6 Leblanc Dialogue - ENGLISH CONTEXT: https://youtu.be/FdLgyv7Zmaw?t=1054
[msg MSG_AKECHI_COOP_C05_02 [Sojiro]]
Sorry kid, I'm fresh out of beans.

I'm gonna head out and get
more tonight, but it'll take a while.

[msg MSG_AKECHI_COOP_C05_03 [Akechi]]
I see... that's a shame.

Well, that place in Kichijoji wasn't too bad.
How about it, [f 4 1]-kun?

[msg MSG_C08_YES_05_00 [Akechi]]
Wonderful.

Well then, let's get going.





--- E726_062.msg --- ENGLISH CONTEXT: https://youtu.be/FdLgyv7Zmaw?t=1084
NOTE: The dialogue here is mostly original but based off of the official dialogue.
The setting was adjusted to take place inside of the Jazz Club.
I probably sent a video showing the new event. In case I didn't please remind me


[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
The atmosphere here is wonderful... It feels a bit
nostalgic, just like last time.

(Player's choice)
So relaxing... Re: MSG_002
You fit right in. Re: MSG_003
Nostalgic, huh? Re: MSG_004

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
It brings back memories. I spent a lot
of time here when I was young.

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
Oh, really? Well I used to come here
frequently when I was younger.

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
I used to spend a lot of time here
when I was younger.

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
Of course, these days I'm the Detective
Prince, but my family situation was...
well, complicated.

By the time I was old enough to realize it,
my father was already gone. My mother
was all I had.

My mother worked at a nearby nightclub.
Whenever she had to bring a man home,
she'd ask an acquaintance here to look after me.

There were always so many people...
I would be seated at a table and sipping on
a glass of water by myself.

Occasionally they would come by and check
up on me, but it was infrequent.

(Player's choice)
That was horrible of her. Re: MSG_007
...You've been through a lot. Re: MSG_009

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
My mother did what she had to. It was
certainly better than me staying.

She quit the nightlife jobs as soon as she
could, and raised me while doing what
part-time work she could find.

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
The only one who deserves blame is my
father. The worthless, degenerate excuse
for a man who abandoned my mother.

I wanted to force him to finally give
her the apology he owes her. But...
that's no longer possible.

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Akechi]]
It's in the past. I have no reason to
blame my mother either.

[msg MSG_009_5_0 [Akechi]]
The only one who deserves blame is my
father. The worthless, degenerate excuse
for a man who abandoned my mother.

I wanted to force him to finally give
her the apology he owes her. But...
that's no longer possible.

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
Sorry. I didn't mean for our conversation
to get so depressing.

We should order our drinks.

(Player's choice, callback to rank 4)
Lead the way. Re: MSG_012
Anything's still fine by me. Re: MSG_013
I'll have the usual! Re: MSG_014

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
Alright, I'll put in an order for us. 

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
Determined to prove me wrong?

Alright, let's put you to the test.
I'll put in a random order.

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
Oh? So you do come here often?
I'm glad to hear it.

I'll call for service, then.

NOTE: Continuation of the last dialogue, will manually provide English reference

[msg MSG_004_5_0 [Jazz Club Manager]]
Thanks for waiting. Here's your order.

We have a special performance today,
so I hope you enjoy it.

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Let's sit back and relax.

(Player thought)
I enjoyed her singing even
more than last time...

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
Ahh, that's nice. There's
nothing better than a cold
drink and some relaxing music.

(Player choices)
Her singing is incredible. - Re: MSG_007
It really hit the spot! - Re: MSG_008
Cheers! - Re: MSG_032

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
I see why they call it a special 
performance.

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
Haha, thats good to hear.

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Akechi]]
Yeah, cheers to us.

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm glad we got to chat here again.

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
I've never told anyone else about my
family situation. I wonder why
I told you? Curious indeed.

Because we get along.
Because we're similar.

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
Now that you mention it, maybe we are
pretty similar deep down...

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
We're both victims of the adults who
unfairly impacted our lives.

I think you're right. Re: MSG_018
I don't know about that. Re: MSG_019
Gonna finish your drink? Re: MSG_020

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
talked with you.

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
met you.

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
You really do things at your own pace,
don't you? I suppose that's one of our
differences.

But perhaps that's simply the strength not
to be bothered by others' perceptions.
In which case... I'm a little envious.

(Player thought)
I feel like my bond with
Akechi is growing deeper...

(Rankup animation)

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Akechi]]
Hmm... we still haven't finished
our drinks.

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Lets see who downs
theirs faster. First to finish wins.

Are you ready?

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.




(UNUSED - REPLACE WITH PLACEHOLDER TEXT)

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
I usually come here when I need some
time to really think on my own.

So chatting with you here is really
quite refreshing.

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, you're the first person I've
ever brought here...

[msg MSG_022_5_0 [Akechi]]
It's not like I was keeping it from anyone,
but... I suppose it goes to show we do
have some strange connection.


[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well then, why don't we get some
drinks?

Any recommendations?
Anything's fine by me.
An ice-cold beer for me.

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
Nothing in particular, but if you don't
mind me choosing, then I'll put in a
random order.

You don't have any soft drinks you
actively dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, I find the people who say
that end up being extremely picky,
in the end.

Anyway, I'll put in an order. You don't
have any soft drinks you dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
...You say that so deadpan, it almost
sounds like you're serious.

I'll pick some drinks, then, shall I?
There aren't any soft drinks you
actively dislike, right?


[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
A cafÃ©, hm? Sounds like you have good
taste.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
Is that so? Now I'm intrigued... You
should show me the place sometime.

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
You live there? I'm... not sure that counts
as a go-to place if you don't actually have
to go anywhere.


[msg MSG_016_5_0 [Akechi]]
That reminds me, do you cook?
