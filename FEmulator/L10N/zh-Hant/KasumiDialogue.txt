That's a good idea. I'll go with

Well, good night, Morgana!

NOTE: Most of this dialogue is original, but it's heavily based on the Yusuke and Ryuji bath scene from above - just with Ann instead of the guys!
[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Ann]]
Ahh, it feels soo nice!
I could stay in here forever.

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Ann]]
It's nice to get away from
the guys for a while. Don't
you think?

Yeah, but it's a bit hot....
She just keeps going...

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Ann]]
Geez, you're right.
I'm sure she'll stop... eventually.

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Ann]]
Hey so since it's just us...
Let's have a little girl talk!
I've been wondering
for a while now...

Girl to girl, what do you think
of the guys?

Ryuji's kinda cute...
Yusuke-kun is so captivating...
Honestly… you stand out the most.
They're both great teammates.

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Ann]]
Ooh, so that's the kind of guy you like!

Ryuji can be a little much,
but he's not so bad once
you get to know him.
Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Ann]]
Kitagawa-kun?!

He's a little... odd... but I guess he can be charming!

Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Ann]]
Umm... that's... not what I meant.

But I get you.

Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
[f 4 2]-chan...

...W-wow haha, I see.
I-I wasn't expecting that...

But it makes me happy to hear that...

...I'm so glad I met you, [f 4 2]...

Let's do more things like this, okay?

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Ann]]
Well, I'm rooting for you
regardless!

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ann]]
Hey... I've been thinking, we really need to find
our next target.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Ann]]
But the more I think about it...
Is going after famous people
really enough?

I mean, seeing people's reactions,
it's been making me think about
what we do...

It should be okay...
I don't know...

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Ann]]
Yeah... we need to be more
cautious from now on.

I don't want this to backfire on us.

We need some kind of plan to
appeal to the public...

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Ann]]
Don't you think we're being too
short-sighted?

I mean, is this really doing us any good?

I think we need a plan to appeal
to the public...

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Ann]]
Hmm...

A plan huh...?

[msg MSG_017_0_0 [Ann]]
Argh, I can't think of anything right now!

Morgana specializes in info
about that world, right? So...

...

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Ann]]
...Ughhhh! It's so damn hot!

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Ann]]
How much do you have to keep adding
until you're satisfied, damn it!?

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Ann]]
Argh! I can't stand it anymore!

Well, I have to get going anyways.
The trains are gonna stop soon.

Let's meet up again early next
week, okay? I'll contact everyone!

And let's hang out more! Got it?

[msg MSG_025_0_0 [Ann]]
See you later!

Well, I guess we'll all just go do our

Oh, but let's snap a quick pic
in our Kimonos!

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Haru]]
Great idea!

...

It couldn't hurt, right?

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Kasumi]]
Looks like it's just us now.

Sorry about skipping the picture,
I didn't want to intrude.

Oh, I was wondering earlier-what did you wish for at the shrine? (No localization needed, this is just for context)

I already forgot...
To stay healthy.
To become irresistible!

Lookin' good!

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Makoto]]
I'm glad you think so. We all agreed to take a
picture of our kimonos.

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Ann]]
Maybe we'll do a group shot next time.

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Yusuke]]
This photo is good in its own way.
Indeed, I believe it will inspire
some good dreams.

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Ryuji]]
But you gotta dream of specific

I'm gonna head out and get
more tonight, but it'll take a while.

[msg MSG_AKECHI_COOP_C05_03 [Akechi]]
I see... that's a shame.

Well, that place in Kichijoji wasn't too bad.
How about it, [f 4 1]-kun?

[msg MSG_C08_YES_05_00 [Akechi]]
Wonderful.

NOTE: The dialogue here is mostly original but based off of the official dialogue.
The setting was adjusted to take place inside of the Jazz Club.
I probably sent a video showing the new event. In case I didn't please remind me


[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
The atmosphere here is wonderful... It feels a bit
nostalgic, just like last time.

So relaxing...
You fit right in.
Nostalgic, huh?

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
It brings back memories. I spent a lot
of time here when I was young.

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
Oh, really? Well I used to come here
frequently when I was younger.

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
I used to spend a lot of time here
when I was younger.

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
Of course, these days I'm the Detective
Prince, but my family situation was...
well, complicated.

By the time I was old enough to realize it,
my father was already gone. My mother
was all I had.

My mother worked at a nearby nightclub.
Whenever she had to bring a man home,
she'd ask an acquaintance here to look after me.

There were always so many people...
I would be seated at a table and sipping on
a glass of water by myself.

Occasionally they would come by and check
up on me, but it was infrequent.

That was horrible of her.
...You've been through a lot.

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
My mother did what she had to. It was
certainly better than me staying.

She quit the nightlife jobs as soon as she
could, and raised me while doing what
part-time work she could find.

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
The only one who deserves blame is my
father. The worthless, degenerate excuse
for a man who abandoned my mother.

I wanted to force him to finally give
her the apology he owes her. But...
that's no longer possible.

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Akechi]]
It's in the past. I have no reason to
blame my mother either.

[msg MSG_009_5_0 [Akechi]]
The only one who deserves blame is my
father. The worthless, degenerate excuse
for a man who abandoned my mother.

I wanted to force him to finally give

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Akechi]]
Sorry. I didn't mean for our conversation
to get so depressing.

We should order our drinks.

Lead the way.
Anything's still fine by me.
I'll have the usual!

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
Alright, I'll put in an order for us.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
Determined to prove me wrong?

Alright, let's put you to the test.
I'll put in a random order.

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
Oh? So you do come here often?
I'm glad to hear it.

I'll call for service, then.

[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well then, why don't we get some
drinks?

Any recommendations?
Anything's fine by me.
An ice-cold beer for me.

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
Nothing in particular, but if you don't
mind me choosing, then I'll put in a
random order.

You don't have any soft drinks you
actively dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, I find the people who say
that end up being extremely picky,
in the end.

Anyway, I'll put in an order. You don't
have any soft drinks you dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
...You say that so deadpan, it almost
sounds like you're serious.

I'll pick some drinks, then, shall I?
There aren't any soft drinks you
actively dislike, right?

[msg MSG_004_5_0 [Jazz Club Manager]]
Thanks for waiting. Here's your order.

We have a special performance today,
so I hope you enjoy it.

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
Ahh, that's nice. There's
nothing better than a cold
drink and some relaxing music.

Her singing is incredible.
It really hit the spot!
Cheers!

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
I see why they call it a
special performance.

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
Haha, thats good to hear.

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Akechi]]
Yeah, cheers to us.

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm glad we got to chat here again.

Because we get along.
Because we're similar.

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
I've never told anyone else about my
family situation. I wonder why
I told you? Curious indeed.

[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
A café, hm? Sounds like you have good
taste.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
Is that so? Now I'm intrigued... You
should show me the place sometime.

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
You live there? I'm... not sure that counts
as a go-to place if you don't actually have
to go anywhere.

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
Now that you mention it, maybe we are
pretty similar deep down...

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
We're both victims of the adults who
unfairly impacted our lives.

[msg MSG_016_5_0 [Akechi]]
That reminds me, do you cook?

I think you're right.
I don't know about that.
Gonna finish your drink?

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
talked with you.

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
met you.

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
You really do things at your own pace,
don't you? I suppose that's one of our
differences.

But perhaps that's simply the strength not
to be bothered by others' perceptions.
In which case... I'm a little envious.

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Akechi]]
Hmm... we still haven't finished
our drinks.

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Lets see who downs
theirs faster. First to finish wins.

Are you ready?

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
I usually come here when I need some
time to really think on my own.

So chatting with you here is really
quite refreshing.

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, you're the first person I've
ever brought here...

[msg MSG_022_5_0 [Akechi]]
It's not like I was keeping it from anyone,
but... I suppose it goes to show we do
have some strange connection.

I feel like my bond with
Akechi is growing deeper...

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Let's sit back and relax.

I enjoyed her singing even
more than last time...

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.
