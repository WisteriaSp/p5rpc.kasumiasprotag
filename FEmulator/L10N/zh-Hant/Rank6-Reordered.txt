[msg MSG_004_5_0 [Jazz Club Manager]]
Thanks for waiting. Here's your order.

We have a special performance today,
so I hope you enjoy it.

[msg MSG_024_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Let's sit back and relax.

(Player thought)
I enjoyed her singing even
more than last time...

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Akechi]]
Ahh, that's nice. There's
nothing better than a cold
drink and some relaxing music.

(Player choices)
Her singing is incredible. - Re: MSG_007
It really hit the spot! - Re: MSG_008
Cheers! - Re: MSG_032

[msg MSG_007_0_0 [Akechi]]
I see why they call it a
special performance.

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Akechi]]
Haha, thats good to hear.

[msg MSG_032_0_0 [Akechi]]
Yeah, cheers to us.

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm glad we got to chat here again.

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Akechi]]
I've never told anyone else about my
family situation. I wonder why
I told you? Curious indeed.

Because we get along.
Because we're similar.

[msg MSG_015_0_0 [Akechi]]
Now that you mention it, maybe we are
pretty similar deep down...

[msg MSG_016_0_0 [Akechi]]
We're both victims of the adults who
unfairly impacted our lives.

I think you're right. Re: MSG_018
I don't know about that. Re: MSG_019
Gonna finish your drink? Re: MSG_020

[msg MSG_018_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
talked with you.

[msg MSG_019_0_0 [Akechi]]
I'm even more sure of that after having
met you.

[msg MSG_020_0_0 [Akechi]]
You really do things at your own pace,
don't you? I suppose that's one of our
differences.

But perhaps that's simply the strength not
to be bothered by others' perceptions.
In which case... I'm a little envious.

(Player thought)
I feel like my bond with
Akechi is growing deeper...

(Rankup animation)

[msg MSG_029_0_0 [Akechi]]
Hmm... we still haven't finished
our drinks.

[msg MSG_030_0_0 [Akechi]]
...Lets see who downs
theirs faster. First to finish wins.

Are you ready?

[msg MSG_031_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.

[msg MSG_027_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well, see you later.

[msg MSG_021_0_0 [Akechi]]
I usually come here when I need some
time to really think on my own.

So chatting with you here is really
quite refreshing.

[msg MSG_022_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, you're the first person I've
ever brought here...

[msg MSG_022_5_0 [Akechi]]
It's not like I was keeping it from anyone,
but... I suppose it goes to show we do
have some strange connection.


[msg MSG_000_0_0 [Akechi]]
Well then, why don't we get some
drinks?

Any recommendations?
Anything's fine by me.
An ice-cold beer for me.

[msg MSG_002_0_0 [Akechi]]
Nothing in particular, but if you don't
mind me choosing, then I'll put in a
random order.

You don't have any soft drinks you
actively dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Akechi]]
You know, I find the people who say
that end up being extremely picky,
in the end.

Anyway, I'll put in an order. You don't
have any soft drinks you dislike, yes?

[msg MSG_004_0_0 [Akechi]]
...You say that so deadpan, it almost
sounds like you're serious.

I'll pick some drinks, then, shall I?
There aren't any soft drinks you
actively dislike, right?


[msg MSG_012_0_0 [Akechi]]
A caf√©, hm? Sounds like you have good
taste.

[msg MSG_013_0_0 [Akechi]]
Is that so? Now I'm intrigued... You
should show me the place sometime.

[msg MSG_014_0_0 [Akechi]]
You live there? I'm... not sure that counts
as a go-to place if you don't actually have
to go anywhere.


[msg MSG_016_5_0 [Akechi]]
That reminds me, do you cook?
